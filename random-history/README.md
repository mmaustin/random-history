## RANDOM HISTORY

Random History is a React App created for those who love history.  It's simple to play:

--Clicking onto a cell triggers the generation of a random number from one to six.
--If the number of the cell matches the random number, the player gets awarded the number of points indicated on
the cell
--If the cell and random numbers are not the same, the player instantly loses the amount of points indicated on the cell and is taken to a quiz question.
--If the player gets the question right, the player gets awarded the number of points indicated on the cell plus an additional point.  The player is not further penalized for getting the question wrong.
--The last cell clicked will always be correct.
--It takes five points to win the game.
